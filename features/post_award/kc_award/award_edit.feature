  As an Award Modifier, I want to be able to make changes to Award documents,
  so that I can correct inaccuracies or enter additional data into optional fields

    And   adds a PI to the Award
    When  another Principal Investigator is added to the Award

    When  the Award's PI is added again with a different role
    Then  the Award should throw an error saying they are already in the Award Personnel
