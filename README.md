Kuality-Coeus: Test Automation
==============================

Overview
--------

This project consists of Cucumber-based test scripts for validating Kuali Coeus functionality

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.9.3 or newer
* TestFactory 0.4.7 or newer
* Watir-webdriver 0.6.4 or newer

In order for the scripts to actually run successfully, you will need to add a `config.yml` file in your /features/support directory.

The contents of that file should be as follows:

```yaml
:basic:
  :url: https://<your.kuali.test.server.address.goes.here>/
  :context: <any.context.value.that.appears.prior.to.query.string>/
  :browser: :ff # ... or :chrome, :safari, etc.
:headless: no # or yes, if you're running in headless mode
:cas: no # or yes, if there is a CAS login page
:cas_context: <the.context.string.for.the CAS.login.page.URL>/
```
